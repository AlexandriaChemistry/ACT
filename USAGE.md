Using the Alexandria Chemistry Toolkit
======================================
To use the ACT, you first need to [install it](INSTALL.md). Then you will need to download the Alexandria Library 
from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1170597.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1170597), unpack it, and set an environment variable 
```AlexandriaLib``` pointing to the root directory of the library. For instance

```export AlexandriaLib=$HOME/work/AlexandriaLib```
