Installing ACT
==============
The Alexandria Chemistry Toolkit (ACT) relies on a number of libraries. Even though we try to keep it to a minimum
some more or less standard libraries are needed.

+ A patched version of OpenBabel is needed that can be found at
https://github.com/dspoel/openbabel. The oficial OpenBabel can be found [here](https://github.com/openbabel).

+ Some version of a library that supports the message passing interface (MPI) for parallel programming. A popular version is [Open MPI](https://open-mpi.org).

+ The [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database engine is need to process experimental data as well as quantum chemistry data from the Alexandria Library, available from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1170597.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1170597).
