Installing ACT
==============
The Alexandria Chemistry Toolkit (ACT) relies on a number of libraries. Even though we try to keep it to a minimum
some more or less standard libraries are needed.

+ OpenBabel
A patched version of OpenBabel is needed that can be found at
https://github.com/dspoel/openbabel 

+ MPI
Some version of a library that supports the message passing interface for parallel programming.
