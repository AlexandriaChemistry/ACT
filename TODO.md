TODO list for the ACT
=====================
Stuff we would like to do in the near future:

+ Implement output of force field files to run simulations using [OpenMM](https://openmm.org)

+ Implement a Genetic Algorithm for parameter optimization

+ Perform profiling of the sequential and parallel ACT code and implement static load-balancing

+ Optimize time-sensitive parts of the code using SIMD

+ Improve documentation and examples

+ Publish papers about applications and code
