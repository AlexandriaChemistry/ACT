The Alexandria Chemistry Toolkit or ACT for short allows for global optimization of force fields for molecular simulation. That means, that in principle a whole force field can be derived at once by tuning parameters to reproduce both experimental data and results from quantum chemistry or density functional theory.

This code is based on the [GROMACS software](http://www.gromacs.org), however it adds about 40000 lines of code for force field development. See [GROMACS.md](https://github.com/dspoel/ACT/blob/main/GROMACS.md) for the copyright message for this part of the code.
